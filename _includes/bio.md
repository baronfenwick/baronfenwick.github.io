> “Pianist Fenwick nearly blew the roof off Merkin Hall with his spectacular, riveting delivery of Copland’s Piano Variations.” - Anne Johnson, Classical Voice North America.

> “Mr. Fenwick already has a very successful domestic and international career. His playing tonight was elegant, lush, and far more mature than would be expected for a young man of his age. This is an artist to keep your eyes and ears on.” - Gerald Cochran, Focus Newspaper

> “Brilliant…. His driving rhythm, virtuosic technique, musical treatment and careful attention to the ensemble were all stunning. Put two or three more years on this young man, and we might well have a major star.” - David Lowry, Columbia Free-Times
